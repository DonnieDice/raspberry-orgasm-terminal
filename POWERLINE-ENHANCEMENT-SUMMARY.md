## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Powerline Segments**: The Oh-My-Posh theme now uses proper background colors for each segment with smooth transitions, creating a true powerline effect.

2. **Enhanced Color Scheme**: Each segment of the prompt now has a distinct background color from the RGX palette, making the powerline more visually appealing.

3. **Better Font Support**: The installer now provides better feedback about font installation and ensures powerline-capable fonts are available.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added tools to verify that the powerline setup is working correctly.

5. **Improved Documentation**: Added detailed instructions for verifying and troubleshooting the powerline setup.

## Expected Result

After these changes, the prompt in Konsole should display as:
```
 hpl  ~/raspberry-orgasm-terminal  main  > 
```

With each segment having:
- A distinct background color from the RGX palette
- Proper foreground text color for contrast
- Smooth powerline transitions between segments
- Correct rendering of powerline symbols

## Verification

To verify the changes are working correctly:
1. Run `./test/verify-konsole-powerline.sh`
2. Check that powerline symbols display without gaps or question marks
3. Verify that colors match the RGX palette
4. Confirm that the Oh-My-Posh prompt renders with proper segment styling
