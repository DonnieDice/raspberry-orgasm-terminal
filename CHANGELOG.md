# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- The `install.sh` script now supports a wider range of Linux distributions by detecting the package manager (`apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`).
- The script now installs all necessary dependencies, including `oh-my-posh`, `powerline-fonts`, `lsd`, `bat`, and `ripgrep`.

### Changed
- The `install.sh` script has been refactored to be more robust and easier to maintain.
